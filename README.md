# AngularPizza
A fully functional AngularJS web app for a fictional Pizza joint - it might not be pretty to look at, but the code is what counts right?

This was created as a code challenge project. The requirements were:
Pizza joint located in Chicago, New York, and San Franscisco
All locations serve 1 meat, 1 veg, and 1 cheese pizza
All veg pizzas have Mushrooms
All meat pizzas have sausage
Users need to select city then pizza choice to see list of toppings

The only technologies to be used were HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (with any current frameworks of my choosing) No Bootstrap or other "pre packaged" CSS libraries.
